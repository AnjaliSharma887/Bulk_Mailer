# Bulk_Mailer Sender

• Developed a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter that allowed users to input and upload their email list,
  compose their email message, and send it to the entire list with a single click.

• Designed the application to work with both plain text and HTML email messages, and included options for
  customizing the sender's name and email address.
  
• Integrated the application with the Gmail API to enable users to send emails directly from their Gmail account,
  ensuring maximum deliverability and avoiding spam filters.
